Overview of school district analysis
-The purpose of the analysis was to replace the fraudulent scores for the 9th graders at Thomas high school.  I then needed to re-due the analysis with the new data.  The analysis wanted to find the total school budget, budget spent per student, the average math and reading scores, the passing math and reading scores and overall passing scores

Results
-The results of the analysis after removing the fraudulent scores from the Freshman did change, but not drastically.  You will be able to see in the snippets that the scores changed by less than a percentage.  The passing percentage for the math and reading for Thomas High were similar throughout even with out those scores.  The analysis shows that even with the 9th grade scores removed the overall passing percentage remained relatively the same.  

Summary
The four changes to the school district analysis after reading and math scores have been replaced are the total student, the number of students counted the average math and reading scores and the overall percentages at Thomas High School.  The decreased students lead to the change in average math and reading scores and passing percentage.  However, the changes proved to be minimal from the first analysis and the analysis with the replaced data.
